"""Split weekly release-branch runs into synthetic per-branch runs.

The ``weekly.yml`` workflow fires once (Sundays, from ``unstable``) and
invokes ``daily.yml`` as a reusable workflow per release branch, so all
branches' jobs land in a single workflow run distinguished only by a job
name prefix like ``run-daily-for-release-branches (8.0) / <job>``.

This module splits one such run into synthetic per-branch runs so every
downstream consumer (report, blame, scorecard) sees an ordered series of
runs per release branch, exactly like the daily and CI series.

Synthetic runs are stored with ``workflow_file = "weekly-split"`` and
``branch = "<X.Y>"``; raw weekly runs keep ``weekly.yml``/``unstable`` so
the two never mix in queries.
